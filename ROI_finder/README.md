# Postprocessing option for Snakemake Pipeline intermediate output.

## Requirements
These scripts require the same setup used for the Snakemake Pipeline.
As input it requires the ref and query ".fasta" files which are also input for the pipeline, and the ".filtered" files, and the "results.tsv" file which are generated by the pipeline.

## Walkthrough
An region of interest (ROI) is needed.
If you know where on the Heinz genome that region is you will need to provide the script with the chromosome it is on, the upper and lower bounds of the region, and a name for the ROI.

A more detailed walkthrough will be posted here in the near future.
In the mean time, the comments in the scripts should be sufficient for one to get started.
